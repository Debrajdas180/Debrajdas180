##  Additional Sections (Optional Enhancements)

If youâ€™d like your GitHub README to be even more complete, consider adding the following sections:

- **Skills**: List languages, protocols, and hardware competencies (e.g., C/C++, Python, IÂ²C, SPI, etc.).
- **Projects**: Showcase live projects with descriptions, highlights, and live demo links or GIFs.
- **Currently Learning**: Mention what you're exploring nextâ€”maybe FPGA development, wireless protocols, or advanced power electronics.
